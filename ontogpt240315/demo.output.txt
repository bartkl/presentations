  '''Miles Dewey Davis III''' (May 26, 1926{{spaced ndash}}September 28, 1991) was an American [[jazz]] trumpeter, bandleader, and composer. He is among the most influential and acclaimed figures in the history of jazz and [[20th century music|20th-century music]]. Davis adopted a variety of musical directions in a roughly five-decade career that kept him at the forefront of many major stylistic developments in jazz.<ref name="allmusic"/>

He left to study at [[Juilliard School|Juilliard]] in New York City, before dropping out and making his professional debut as a member of saxophonist [[Charlie Parker]]'s [[bebop]] quintet from 1944 to 1948. Shortly after, he recorded the ''[[Birth of the Cool]]'' sessions for [[Capitol Records]], which were instrumental to the development of [[cool jazz]]. In the early 1950s, Davis recorded some of the earliest [[hard bop]] music while on [[Prestige Records]] but did so haphazardly due to a heroin addiction. After a widely acclaimed comeback performance at the [[Newport Jazz Festival]], he signed a long-term contract with [[Columbia Records]], and recorded the album ''[['Round About Midnight]]'' in 1955.{{sfn|Yanow|2005|p=176}} It was his first work with saxophonist [[John Coltrane]] and bassist [[Paul Chambers]], key members of the sextet he led into the early 1960s. During this period, he alternated between orchestral jazz collaborations with arranger [[Gil Evans]], such as the Spanish music-influenced ''[[Sketches of Spain]]'' (1960), and band recordings, such as ''[[Milestones (Miles Davis album)|Milestones]]'' (1958) and ''[[Kind of Blue]]'' (1959).<ref name="aar" /> The latter recording remains one of the most popular jazz albums of all time,{{sfn|McCurdy|2004|p=61}} having sold over five million copies in the U.S.

  Davis made several lineup changes while recording ''[[Someday My Prince Will Come (Miles Davis album)|Someday My Prince Will Come]]'' (1961), his [[In Person Friday and Saturday Nights at the Blackhawk, Complete|1961 Blackhawk concerts]], and ''[[Seven Steps to Heaven]]'' (1963), another commercial success that introduced bassist [[Ron Carter]], pianist [[Herbie Hancock]], and drummer [[Tony Williams (drummer)|Tony Williams]].<ref name="aar"/> After adding saxophonist [[Wayne Shorter]] to his new quintet in 1964,<ref name="aar">{{cite web|url=http://www.aaregistry.org/historic_events/view/miles-davis-innovative-influential-and-respected-jazz-legend|title=Miles Davis, innovative, influential, and respected jazz legend|publisher=African American Registry|access-date=June 11, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160809095005/http://www.aaregistry.org/historic_events/view/miles-davis-innovative-influential-and-respected-jazz-legend|archive-date=August 9, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Davis led them on a series of more abstract recordings often composed by the band members, helping pioneer the [[post-bop]] genre with albums such as ''[[E.S.P. (Miles Davis album)|E.S.P.]]'' (1965) and ''[[Miles Smiles]]'' (1967),<ref>{{cite web|last=Bailey|first=C.
