## Goals of the talk
- Decentralization is important
    - Bottom up WoWs ask for it
    - Collabs and data sharing across boundaries
- Decentralized 


## Challenges
* work being done in silos


## From the end
* To more easily share data and collaborate, we need to decentralize
    * No bottlenecks from gatekeeping
    * Avoid endless discussions on hard (or impossible) to reconcile definitions and models
    * Once you start sharing outside of the company, it becomes decentralized anyways
* In a decentralized architecture, you need contracts
    * You cannot expect (and are certainly not guaranteed) people to use the same tools, but can specify a contract
    * Part of the contract is information modeling
* Contracts and in particular information models should be machine readable
    * Tool interoperability
    * Formality ensures quality
    * Migrations are relatively easy when changing/extending tools or languages
* Specific


### Until what point?
- Show LinkML snippet YAML
- Show diagram of how you use the profiler (OR something else) to profile a data product from a LinkML schema
- Show generated documentation and mention the ease of generation
    - It's web, so easily refereable, everything has a URL
- Mention limitations and open questions
    - LinkML emphasizes logical modeling, but can also do some term and conceptual, should we want it for that?
    - What tooling are we really missing?
